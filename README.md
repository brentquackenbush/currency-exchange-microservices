OpenZipkin for Distributed Tracing (helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in service architectures)
Feign is used as a load balancer between multiple applications.
Eureka is used for a naming server to name the multiple applications
Using a framework in springboot called sleuth, we are able to put a unique id on the request that could go across multiple microservices so we are able to track the response that gets sent back. 
Circuit breaker basically allows a microservice to return a fallback response if the microservice that this current microservice is dependent on is slow or down. It helps reduce load.
