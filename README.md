Using a framework in springboot called sleuth, we are able to put a unique id on the request that could go across multiple microservices so we are able to track the response that gets sent back. 

Circuit breaker basically allows a microservice to return a fallback response if the microservice that this current microservice is dependent on is slow or down. It helps reduce load.
