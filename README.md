### Some notes while going over the course: 

### [What is an API gateway? ](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-does-an-api-gateway-do#:~:text=An%20API%20gateway%20is%20an,and%20return%20the%20appropriate%20result.)

### [What is a naming server? ](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-a-nameserver/)
- Used Eureka for a naming server

### [What is Rabbit MQ? ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)

### [What is distributed tracing? ](https://www.datadoghq.com/knowledge-center/distributed-tracing/#:~:text=Distributed%20tracing%20is%20a%20method,exhibit%20high%20latency%20or%20errors.)
- Used OpenZipkin for distributed tracing for this project.

### [What is a load balancer? ](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/load-balancing/)

- Used Feign as a load balancer.

Using a framework in springboot called sleuth, we are able to put a unique id on the request that could go across multiple microservices so we are able to track the response that gets sent back. 

Circuit breaker basically allows a microservice to return a fallback response if the microservice that this current microservice is dependent on is slow or down. It helps reduce load.
